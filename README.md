This optimized XGBoost model predicts the Urban Heat Island (UHI) Index using Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellite data. It selects key features, including B01, B06, B11, NDVI, LST, and UTFVI, to capture temperature variations and vegetation influence on urban heat. To improve performance, RandomizedSearchCV is used to fine-tune hyperparameters, optimizing learning rate, tree depth, and sampling rates.
